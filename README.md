# GUI-Perceptual-Grouping
Detect graphic user interface (GUI) elements from the GUI image and recognize the repetitive layout structure through grouping the elemetns.

## What is it?
On GUIs, we do not just see a collection of separated texts, images, buttons, etc.
Instead,we see perceptual groups of GUI widgets, such as card, list, tab and menu.

Although humans can intuitively see perceptual groups of GUI widgets, current computational approaches are rather limited in partitionnig a GUI into meaningful groups of widget elements, especially for pure image-based techniques.
Thus, the GUI Perceptual Grouping is proposed to mimic hwo us human being perceive the GUI to recognize and gather the atomic GUI element into structured groups.

### Gelstalt Principles
The approch's design uses a well-established psychological theory, the Gelstalt principles of perception, for reference to develop its core algorithms.
Gelstalt theory systematically explains how humans see the whole rather than individual and unrelated parts.
It includes a set of principles of grouping, among which `connectedness`, `similarity`, `proximity` and `continuity` are the most essential ones.

>Connectedness

>Similarity

>Proximity

>Contiuity
